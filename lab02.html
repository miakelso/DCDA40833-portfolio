            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this exploration, I chose to work with Pika and Leonardo.ai because I had never used either platform before and wanted to experience different types of AI creative tools. While I have created AI-generated images using other platforms, such as Microsoft Copilot, I was curious to see how another image-generation platform would perform in comparison. I had also never used a video AI generator, so Pika offered an opportunity to experiment with motion and animation. My goal was to explore what I could create and how realistic the outputs could appear, especially after seeing viral AI-generated videos, such as the well-known “bunnies on a trampoline” clip. This exploration allowed me to test the capabilities, limitations, and creative potential of both video and image-focused AI tools in ways I had not previously experienced.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Pika</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Pika performed well when handling imaginative and layered prompts. When I asked it to create a video of Maggie Smith walking in a mall with a lush rainbow wig and a group of leprechauns, the tool successfully included a mall setting and leprechauns walking together. This showed that Pika can combine multiple prompt elements and generate general movement in a video format. However, Pika fell short in several important ways. Even though I explicitly asked it to use Maggie Smith herself, the character in the video was simply a random older woman with no recognizable resemblance. The rainbow wig also did not fully cover her head. This indicates that Pika does not accurately depict real people, even when directly instructed to do so. Pika also struggled with precise motion. When I uploaded a photo of my dog and asked it to “make him dance,” the result was just my dog jumping up and down. Refining the prompt to “make a video of my dog dancing the hustle” produced nearly the same video, with no meaningful change in movement. This suggests that Pika has difficulty understanding specific dance styles or translating them into distinct motion, especially for animals.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Pika is well suited for imaginative video content where realism and accuracy are not critical. It works best for creative experimentation, visual brainstorming, or short animated storytelling where general movement is acceptable. Poor use cases include projects that require accurate depictions of real people, precise choreography, or specific physical actions. It would also be a weak choice for professional or educational content that depends on realism or exact interpretation of prompts.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>One major ethical concern with Pika is the potential for misleading or deceptive content, particularly involving real people. Although Pika did not accurately depict Maggie Smith, the ability to request real individuals raises concerns about consent and misrepresentation. Pika does not clearly communicate how it handles likenesses, which places responsibility on the user to consider ethical boundaries. Even with its limitations, the tool could still be misused if outputs are shared without context.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Leonardo.ai</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Leonardo.ai showed strengths in creating artistic and thematic imagery. When I attempted the Maggie Smith prompt, the tool rejected it due to content safety guidelines. After removing the leprechauns, it generated an image of an older woman with rainbow hair outdoors. While the result was creative, it did not closely match the original prompt or setting, showing that Leonardo.ai prioritizes safety and interpretation over exact replication. When I uploaded a photo of my dog and asked it to “make him dance,” Leonardo.ai produced an image of the dog standing on two legs. More specific prompts, such as “disco point” or “dancing the hustle,” did not significantly change the dog’s posture. Instead, the AI adjusted the environment. For example, the “hustle” prompt placed my dog in a disco scene with dancers in the background and a more cartoon-like style. This suggests that Leonardo.ai responds more strongly to contextual and stylistic cues than to specific physical actions.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Leonardo.ai is well suited for artistic illustrations, themed visuals, and creative environments. It works especially well when the goal is to suggest mood, style, or narrative through setting rather than exact action. It is less appropriate for tasks that require realistic motion, precise physical positioning, or accurate depiction of real people. Users should not expect it to faithfully reproduce specific actions like dance moves.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Leonardo.ai directly addresses ethical concerns through content safety restrictions. By blocking prompts involving real celebrities, the tool reduces the risk of misuse, misrepresentation, and consent violations. However, these restrictions also limit creative freedom and can result in outputs that feel disconnected from the original prompt. While Leonardo.ai takes a more proactive approach to ethics than Pika, users still need to critically evaluate how AI-generated images may be interpreted or shared.</p>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>AI tools like Pika and Leonardo.ai have strong potential in academic and professional work because they allow rapid exploration of ideas, visual experimentation, and creative storytelling. They make it possible to test concepts quickly and expand creative possibilities, but outputs are often imprecise or stylized, so careful human judgment is still necessary. In the DCDA program, these tools could enhance design, visualization, and prototyping skills while reinforcing the importance of critical thinking, observation, and ethical reasoning. As AI evolves, it is important to consider how accurately a tool interprets prompts, how it handles ethical concerns, whether outputs can be customized, and whether it truly supports the task at hand. Approaching AI this way ensures it remains a tool to enhance, rather than replace, human creativity and insight.</p>
