            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> Hi everyone! My name is Mia Kelso, and I am a senior at TCU studying Digital Culture & Data Analytics and Mathematics. One interesting fact about me is that I visited over 10 countries in the past 5 years. </p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I love to learn how things work and how to fix them, which is what drew me to DCDA. With DCDA, I can effectively analyze a problem and come up with a unique solution to solve it. I hope to become an engineer using these skills after I graduate in May of 2026!</p> <!-- I wanted to include my career aspirations because I plan to showcase this work in interviews-->
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> Through this course, I hope to learn how to code with HTML and CSS expertly. These skills will be highly beneficial to my career in the future.</p>

                <img src="images/Headshot 200x200 pixels.jpg" alt="Photo of Mia Kelso">     <!-- I had trouble here with my photo quality and size. I changed the photo to a 200x200 size and put the width at 100%, but the quality was terrible and the image was huge. I didn't really understand what I did wrong, so I asked for help. We figured out that I needed to remove the width portion size I resized the photo manually, maximize the image quality (used canva), and increase the photo size to 400x400, since 200x200 was too small. These changes work out well for my photo! -->
