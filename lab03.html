            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Maria Sierra’s A Week of Thank You is a visualization in which she represents the number of times she says “thank you” each day over seven days using petals that form flowers. According to Sierra, she “represented these levels as petals that come together to form beautiful flowers, reminiscent of how we use flowers as a way to express gratitude.” For this project, she chose flowers, which are a symbol of peacefulness, love, and thanks. I think the act of saying “thank you” can come not just from gratitude but also from love, similar to the idea of “love thy neighbor.” The visualization reflects this emotional layer through organic shapes, textures, and colors, showing how Sierra experiments with artistic forms to express emotions that words cannot always capture.
            </p>
            <p>From a design perspective, the visualization does not include chartjunk. The style is very simple and clean, only including the flowers, the legend explaining intensity levels, and the title. Because of this simplicity, the data-ink ratio is strong. Every element that appears on the page communicates some type of information. The petals represent each time she said “thank you,” and the color of each petal represents the intensity level, ranging from polite acknowledgment to profound gratitude. There are no unnecessary decorative elements that distract from the data itself. When applying Tufte’s concept of information resolution, the visualization would likely be considered low resolution. The chart shows general patterns, such as which days had more or fewer thank yous, but it does not include labeled numbers or precise counts beyond the days themselves. For example, while we can visually tell that day 7 has the most petals, the exact number is not immediately clear from the graphic alone. If Sierra had included the number of petals, maybe in the center of each flower, the resolution would be higher because viewers could easily interpret exact quantities rather than estimate visually. 
            </p>
            <p>Sierra also mentions in her art introduction that many times she said thank you “automatically, without even thinking.” This made me wonder about cultural influences, since expressions of thanks can vary culturally and regionally. From my research, I believe she is from Spain. According to the website, Cultural Atlas, “Please and Thank you are not said as habitually in Spain. This is not intended to be rude. Rather, some Spanish may find it a bit excessive to express profuse gratitude and politeness throughout everyday exchanges.” This made me think about how the number of thank yous might change if the same experiment were done somewhere like the southern United States. Personally, I feel like I say “thank you” over 20 times during a meal out. Sierra’s day with the most thank yous was day 7, which visually appears to have the most petals, and it even makes me wonder if that day might have been a Sunday, although the graphic does not provide that level of detail.</p>


            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p> In addition to information resolution, two additional concerns from Tufte’s framework that apply here are effects without causes and overreaching. The visualization provides limited contextual information. While there is some context explaining why each petal is a certain color through the legend and the different intensity levels of the thank yous, it does not really convey the context behind those thank yous. For example, I think it would be interesting if the graphic were interactive, where you could hover over a petal and see a short explanation about what prompted that moment of gratitude. Something like “Had the door held open for me” or “Received a gift” would help the viewer understand the causes behind the data. Without this information, the visualization shows outcomes but not the reasons behind them, which reflects Tufte’s concern about effects without causes. </p>

            <h3>Overreaching</h3>
            <p>There is also a risk of overreaching in interpretation. The flowers visually suggest that gratitude is inherently beautiful and emotionally meaningful, but the data itself only shows frequency and intensity levels. We cannot fully determine whether each thank you was deeply felt or simply automatic. Because of this, the emotional symbolism of the flowers may go slightly beyond what the data alone can support.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, Sierra’s visualization is visually appealing and emotionally expressive while maintaining a clean design with a strong data-ink ratio and no chartjunk. However, according to Tufte’s framework, the piece has relatively low information resolution and leaves important contextual questions unanswered. Adding numeric labels, contextual explanations, or interactive elements would make the visualization more informative while still preserving its artistic style. Even with these limitations, the visualization succeeds in creatively representing a week of thank yous and encourages viewers to reflect on their own everyday expressions of thanks.</p>
